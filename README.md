# Bayesian_mixed_type_spatial_model
This repository corresponds to the data analysis section of the article "Scalable Bayesian inference for high-dimensional mixed-type multivariate spatial data".

## Simulation study-1 (Gaussian-Poisson response analysis)
### The folder GP_joint corresponds to the analysis of our joint model over 50 replicated simulated data sets for sample sizes $n = 100$ and $n = 2500$, with "weak" and "strong" spatial correlations, using $\phi = 0.1$ and $\phi = 0.5$. Estimation summaries and predictive analyses are provided in Table 2 and Table 4.

### The folder GP_separate corresponds to the analysis of the separate model over 50 replicated simulated data sets for sample sizes $n = 100$ and $n = 2500$, with "weak" and "strong" spatial correlations, using $\phi = 0.1$ and $\phi = 0.5$. Estimation summaries and predictive analyses are provided in Table 2 and Table 4.

## Simulation study-2 (Gaussian-Bernoulli response analysis)
### The folder GB_joint corresponds to the analysis of our joint model over 50 replicated simulated data sets for sample sizes $n = 100$ and $n = 2500$, with "weak" and "strong" spatial correlations, using $\phi = 0.1$ and $\phi = 0.5$. Estimation summaries and predictive analyses are provided in Table 3 and Table 5.

Estimation summaries and predictive analyses are provided in Table 3 and Table 5.

## Real data analysis

### The folders M1_estimation, M2_estimation, and M3_estimation correspond to the analysis in Table 6.
